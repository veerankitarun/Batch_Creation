@echo off 
rem this start helps to open 2 different script at a same time in 2 different windows
start python "C:\Users\TARUN\Desktop\Bat Files\app.py"
start python "C:\Users\TARUN\Desktop\KeyBoard Test Script\src\app.py"
pause


you can add additional parameters to the start command, such as /B to start an application 
without creating a new window or /WAIT to make the batch file wait until the application or 
process started by start ends.

For example, to start a program without creating a new window:
start /B notepad.exe

And to wait for the program to finish:
start /WAIT notepad.exe

The start command in batch scripting is quite versatile, allowing you to control the behavior
 of the initiated process
